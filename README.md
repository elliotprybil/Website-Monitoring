# Website-Monitoring

This is my project from the first year of my Bachelor's. The purpose here is to be notified as soon as a website will drop an item you are looking for. 

## Sneakers.py

This is the basic python script to monitor most sneaker websites. You can add your proxies and change URLs.

## Sneakers2.py

This script is a little more sophisticated compared to Sneakers.py. With this script, you can sort/filter your research to get a notification for a specific item. E.g. "Jordan 4 metallic green". You just have to put your filter(s). 
The website scrapped is here Yoox, but you can change the URL.
