# Website-Monitoring

Be among the first notified when a website drops an item you are looking for. 

You can also use these scripts for other purposes such as medical appointments (e.g. VITE MA DOSE for Covid-19 Vaccines). 

## Sneakers.py

This is the basic python script to monitor most sneaker websites. You can add your proxies and change URLs.

## Sneakers2.py

This script is a little more sophisticated compared to Sneakers.py. With this script, you can sort/filter your research to get a notification for a specific item. E.g. "Jordan 4 metallic green". You just have to put your filter(s). 

The website scrapped is here Yoox, but you can change the URL. 

## Watches.py

This script enables you to monitor most of the watch's website and get notified on discord. The purpose here is to be notified when someone sells a watch cheaper than the market price. With the script, you can be ahead of other resellers. 

The script is a little more sophisticated than the previous monitors and requested much more time to have something working. But a the end, the script is really broken to the basis, and any junior developer could understand it. 

# DO NOT FORGET TO DOWNLOAD ALL PACKAGES BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT. E.G. IN YOUR TERMINAL "npm install node-fetch"
